```

## Your own API keys (optional)

The app ships **without any API keys**. You can enter your own free keys in the app under **Settings > API keys**:

| Service | Used for | Key |
|---|---|---|
| TMDB | posters, descriptions in your language, cast, trailers, automatic genres, episode info, similar titles | free, see below |
| OMDb | IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings | free, see below |
| TheIntroDB | intro/recap/credits times | no key needed |

**Without keys** the app still works. With an Xtream Codes playlist it takes description, cover, rating, genres, running time and trailer **directly from your provider** (`player_api.php`). With a TMDB key it uses TMDB first and falls back to the provider when a title is not found. Keys are stored only on the device.

### Get a free TMDB key
1. Create an account at https://www.themoviedb.org/signup and confirm the e-mail address.
2. **Log in.** The API page shows "restricted" as long as you are not logged in.
3. Open https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api (or: profile picture > Settings > API) and click **Request an API key**.
4. Choose **Developer**, accept the terms and fill in the form (application name e.g. "IPVIO Stream", type "Personal use", a short description; the URL can be your GitHub page).
5. Copy the **API Key** (the 32-character one, not the "API Read Access Token").

### Get a free OMDb key
1. Open https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx, choose **FREE** (1,000 requests per day), enter your e-mail address and a short reason (e.g. "personal media player").
2. You receive an e-mail with an 8-character key and an **activation link**. Click the link, otherwise the key does not work.

### Enter the keys in the app
Settings > **API keys**: paste the key into the field, press **Save and check** (a green "Key valid" confirms it) and restart the app once. Tip: type long keys with the phone import or an USB keyboard instead of the remote.

*This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.*

## Building

Requirements: Android Studio (current version) with the Android SDK; the Gradle wrapper downloads everything else.

```
git clone <this repository>
cd IPVIO-Stream
./gradlew assembleDebug        # Windows: gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

The APK is then in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. For releases and in-app updates see [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md): every release must be signed with the same key (`keystore.properties`), otherwise users lose their data when updating.

Optional Google Drive backup: [docs/GOOGLE_DRIVE.md](docs/GOOGLE_DRIVE.md).

Developers can optionally copy `secrets.properties.example` to `secrets.properties` (ignored by Git) and put their keys there; they are only used when no key was entered in the app.

Unit tests for the pure logic: `./gradlew test`
